# References to declared variables is possible with the {{ <var> }} syntax.
# You can also use the same syntax to refer to existing system environment variables.

# Use the 'packages' field to list all the ROS packages to be considered.
# Each package has an unique identifier <package_PKG> and consists of a list of jobs.
#
# Each job has an unique job identifier <job_JOB> and has associated a list of plugins
# and their respective keyword arguments. 
# 
# You can execute jobs (all packages) with the command:
# rigel run job <job_JOB>
